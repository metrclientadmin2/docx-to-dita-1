From the Windows run menu, type:</p><p><b>PING -n 10 &lt;IP address></b></p><p>where &lt;<i>IP address</i>> is the IP address of a remote device such as your ISP’s DNS server.</p><p>If the path is functioning correctly, replies as in the previous section are displayed. If you do not receive replies:</p><ul><li>Check that your PC has the IP address of your router listed as the default gateway. If the IP configuration of your PC is assigned by DHCP, this information will not be visible in your PC’s Network Control Panel. Verify that the IP address of the router is listed as the TCP/IP default gateway.</li><li>Check to see that the network address of your PC (the portion of the IP address specified by the netmask) is different from the network address of the remote device.</li><li>If your ISP assigned a host name to your PC, enter that host name as the Account Name in the Basic Settings menu.</li></ul></conbody></concept>
